Summary
-------

*   I evaluated three solutions for blogging: WordPress, Ghost, and Jekyll
*   WordPress is the most popular blogging platform that is highly customizable and easy to use. However, it contains too much bloat for me.
*   Ghost provides a simpler and more elegant user experience, but the lack of customization with its small ecosystem is questionable.
*   Jekyll is the most customizable solution, bringing many advantages like speed, security, simplicity, and portability, but requires more technical knowledge.

I wanted to return to blogging. Not to make money, but to have some kind of internet presence and an outlet for sharing my thoughts, even if no one may read them.

One of the biggest challenges I face is picking a blogging platform. They each have their unique features as well as pros and cons. I needed to weigh these aspects and determine which platform was the best for my use case. That use case being needing a simple solution for blogging with as little bloat as possible.

I only have personal experience with WordPress, Ghost, and Static Site Generators (namely Jekyll). I'll share my thoughts and experiences on each one and then explain which solution I settled on.

I hope this post helps you, but as this is for choosing a platform for personal blogging, if you have another use case, you should check other people's opinions.

What I am Looking for in a Platform
-----------------------------------

Before diving into each solution, I wanted to figure out what I am looking for in a platform. 

*   **Simplicity:** The platform has only a few moving parts. I'm able to get a site up and going quickly.
*   **Portability:** If I ever need to change platforms, is there a process for exporting my content and moving with ease?
*   **Good user experience:** Am I able to do the tasks I need to do without struggling much?
*   **Cost:** How much will it cost to run this blog?

WordPress.org
-------------

WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) for creating websites. With its expansive ecosystem and support, you can make all sorts of websites. Aside from blogs, you can make e-commerce stores and membership sites as well. When people ask what they should make a blog with, WordPress tends to be the go-to answer.

It's easy to set up as many web hosts offer 1-click solutions that can create your blog within minutes. After creating the blog, you can configure its settings easily. You don't need to know how to code and little technical knowledge is required. Furthermore, there are thousands of themes and plugins available, so you don't need to create your own. If you need something, someone has most likely already provided a solution for it. 

However, I question the need for all the bells and whistles that WordPress comes with. While I can decide how complex my WordPress blog should be, I still find the base setup relatively bloated for my preferences.

Overall, WordPress can be powerful, but it offers more features than I need.

Ghost
-----

Ghost was the product of someone's [dissatisfaction with WordPress's growing complexity](https://ghost.onolan.org/). That person was John O'Nolan, who was the former deputy lead of the WordPress user interface team. As a result, Ghost was born. It specifically focuses on blogging, but it particularly caters towards those who want to monetize and gain a following through memberships and exclusive content.

I love the simplicity of Ghost. It just has the core features for blogging and nothing more. The user interface and themes are minimal but still elegant. If you want to expand on it though, Ghost doesn't really have plugins, but has integrations. Instead of downloading something from a centralized store, you're connecting Ghost to a third-party tool. One example of this would be Google Analytics. To implement Google Analytics, you create an account there and then take its code and inject it using Ghost's Code Injection setting.

The simplicity of Ghost makes for a pleasant and efficient writing experience. On top of that, it supports markdown, allowing me to format my content with ease.

However, I question the lack of customization options, as there aren't as many out-of-the-box solutions. I get that it prioritizes making content, but there could be some things I'd like to have. For example, a media library for managing my visual content. Despite these limitations, though, Ghost can be a decent option. 

Overall, Ghost can help me get started with blogging as soon as possible, but I would probably need to consider workaround solutions as they come.

Jekyll
------

One thing that is cool about Jekyll is that they do not require a backend. Your blog content is stored in Markdown files. This brings many advantages such as speed, security, simplicity, and portability. These sites are lightweight and load quickly.

On the other hand, Jekyll is the most technical solution for blogging. It requires a few more steps to get a site running. I personally don't think the process is too bad, but when something goes wrong, you'll need to know how to troubleshoot it, which can be tricky. Regardless, I am trying to limit as much time doing the technical stuff as possible and more time writing.

As well, aside from adding posts and creating pages, many features are not included. If you want anything like comments, analytics, and other special features, you will need to find a third-party tool or code it yourself. As well, Jekyll does not have a CMS, so any content creation I want to do will have to be manually done or I will have to hook up a CMS.

Overall, I like Jekyll for its advantages, but I don't want to bother with the technical aspects.

My Choice
---------

After evaluating the solutions, my final choice will be... **GHOST**! I think it provides the best user experience out of the three and fits my preferences the most. Any shortcomings can be worked around, but I do not have many requirements. Referring back to the "What I am Looking for in a Platform" section, Ghost meets these requirements in my opinion.

*   **Simplicity:** Ghost just has the basic features for blogging. There is little bloat.
*   **Portability:** There are solutions available if I ever need to replace Ghost.
*   **Good user experience:** Configuring the blog is easy and the process for publishing blog posts is straight forward.
*   **Cost:** With my host, it costs between 2-3 dollars a month to run at this time, a very affordable solution.

The other two solutions are also great, but they are not for me. This post helped me evaluate each solution and finally choose which platform I want to use. Hopefully, I can stick with Ghost but I can always revisit this topic down the line.
